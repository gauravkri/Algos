    /*
    Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
    Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    The lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day, the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6.
    Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5.

    Input: prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1}
    Output: 0
    Explanation: Since the array is in decreasing order, no possible way exists to solve the problem.
